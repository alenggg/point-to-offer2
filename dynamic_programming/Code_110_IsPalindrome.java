/**
 * Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
 *
 * For example,
 * "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"is a palindrome.
 * "race a car"is not a palindrome.
 *
 * Note:
 * Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.
 *
 * For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
